NAME
    YAML - YAML Serialization of JavaScript Data

SYNOPSIS
        var yaml = YAML.dump(node);

DESCRIPTION
    This module exposes a "YAML.dump()" function for serializing an object
    in YAML. This module does not yet have a facility for parsing/loading
    YAML.

CAUTION
    This module is extremely young. It will loop on recursive data. It has
    only been tested on FireFox. Etc. Don't even bother using it yet.
    Seriously.
